# odin-recipes

This project is to practice basics of git and html. This project will 
display creation of a repository, cloning it to my machine, and 
performing commits at regular intervals to practice updating the 
snapshot of the project at appropriate times. It will allow for 
practice with writing meaningful commit messages, as well as the chance
to practice the basics of html with a project in mind.
