    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A homemade Smash Burger is quick and easy to make. These fly off the grill in minutes so it’s a great way to feed a crowd.

    Smash burgers have the iconic flavor profile of classic Burgers, but that double burger patty with cheese melted in between is irresistible and you’ll love the special sauce.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ground Beef</strong> - We use 1.5 lbs of 80/20 beef to make 4 double-patty burgers, but you can easily scale the recipe up to feed a crowd (use 3 lbs for 8 double-patty burgers).</li>
        <li><strong>Sauce</strong> - A simple combination of mayo and yellow mustard is what we use to grill and assemble the burgers.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese</strong> - we love thick-sliced medium cheddar cheese for burgers, but you can use American-style cheese or your favorite sliced cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Buns</strong> - brioche buns taste great and have that steakhouse burger look, but any burger bun will work</li>
        <li><strong>Lettuce</strong> - thinly slice your iceberg lettuce for a restaurant-style smash burger</li>
        <li><strong>Pickles</strong> - sliced dill pickle chips are the best</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong> - Select meaty and large-sized tomatoes for burgers and cut them into rings</li>
        <li><strong>Red onion</strong> - thinly sliced into rings</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare Patties</strong> - Divide 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef into 8 equal portions (3 oz each), cover, and refrigerate until ready to cook.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Sauce</strong> - Stir together 1/3 cup mayo and 1 tsp mustard and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prep Toppings</strong> - fully prep your toppings ahead to assemble the burgers right away while the patties are hot and juicy off the grill.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast buns</strong> - lightly butter the cut side of your buns and toast on a griddle or skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Transfer to a rack.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook patties</strong> - increase to medium-high heat. Depending on your surface area, place 2 to 4 cold pieces of meat onto the hot surface. Working quickly, cover each piece with a sheet of parchment paper and smash each into a thin patty. Remove parchment paper, season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, add a dab of sauce, and flip. Sear for 2 minutes on the first side and about a minute on the second side.</li>
        <li><strong>Add cheese</strong> - place a slice of cheese onto half of the patties and top with a second patty and remove from heat. Serve warm over toasted buns with toppings.</li>
        
    </ol>
